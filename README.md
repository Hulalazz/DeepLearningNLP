# Natural Language Processing
Definition: Area of study dedicated to the automatic manipulation of speech and text by software

## Syllabus

1. Foundations: Gentle intro to NLP, deep learning, and the combination of the two
2. Data Preparation: How to clean, prepare, and encode text ready for modeling with neural networks
3. Bag of Words: Discover the bag-of-words model, a staple representation for machine learning and good starting point for neural networks for sentiment analysis
4. Word Embeddings: Discover more powerful word representation in word embeddings, how to develop them as standalone models, and how to learn them as part of neural net models
5. Text Classification: Discover how to leverage word embeddings and CNNs to learn spatial invariant models of text for sentiment analysis, a successor to bag-of-words model
6. Language Modeling: Discover how to develop character-based and word-based language models, a technique required as a part of any text generating model
7. Image Captioning: Discover how to combine pre-trained object recognition model with language model to automatically caption images
8. Machine Translation: Discover how to combine two language models to automatically translate text from one language to another



Neural network algorithms are stochastic -they will make different predictions when same model configuration is trained on the same training data
