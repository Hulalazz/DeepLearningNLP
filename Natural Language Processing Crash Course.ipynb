    "Definition -Automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech or text, by software\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is hard:\n",
    ">Human language is highly ambiguous â€¦ It is also ever changing and evolving. People are great at producing language and understanding language, and are capable of expressing, perceiving, and interpreting very elaborate and nuanced meanings. At the same time, while we humans are great users of language, we are also very poor at formally understanding and describing the rules that govern language.\n",

    "-Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly -text must be converted into numbers. Specifically, vectors of numbers. This is called feature extraction or feature encoding.\n",
